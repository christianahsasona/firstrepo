            <p><b>About Web Development Training</b></p>
                The Online Web Development Training by Internshala is a 6-weeks training program in the fields of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQLi. In this training program,</P><P> you will learn multiple web technologies that will enable you to create your own web projects. This training program is created by Internshala’s team of experts who have built Internshala website,</P><p> Android app and this awesome training platform.
                You will learn through video tutorials.</P><p> For a great hands-on learning experience, this training program is packed with assignments, assessment tests, code challenges, quizzes, and exercises. At the end of this training program, you will build an e-commerce website that will work seamlessly across different devices. For doubt clearing, you can post your queries on the forum and get answers within 24 hours. Following are the detailed table of contents of this training:</p>
                The text-indent property can also accept a percentage width. The percentage width assigned
by the text-indent property depends on the width of the element’s parent. For instance, if a <p>
element were to be assigned a fi xed width of 200 pixels and is inside a  with a width of 800px,
the indention of the fi rst line of the <p> element would be 80 pixels. It is rare to use percentage
values because, as you can see, they are harder to control.
Like the letter-spacing and word-spacing properties, the text-indent property can accept a
negative value. In that case, the text will be shifted to the outside of the text, to the left in left-toright
languages such as English.
In the next section, I discuss the text-align property.

        <p><b>IP SPOOFING</b></p>
            <p>DDoS attack is often characterized by spoofing of source IP
                address to disguise its identity to disallow easy trace back or
                deceive the Cloud Provider to enjoy certain service accrued to
                a trusted host.<br /> The methods used to detect spoofed IP can be
                generally classified as either passive or active.</P>
               <p> A. Spoofed IP Packet detection methods
                Hop-Count Filtering (HCF) is a method proposed by [3] and<br />
                was used to filter flooding traffic during a DDoS attack by
                using the Time-to-Live (TTL) value of the source packet
                header. The hop count value is compared with the value</p>
                <p>OS fingerprinting highly depends on whether it is active or
                    passive. Active fingerprinting involves sending a specially
                    crafted probe packet towards the true source while passive
                    obtains the header features from incoming packets [6].<br />
                    Common active fingerprinting tools include Nmap, Xprobe2
                    and SinFP while passive fingerprinting tools includes p0f
                    (Passive OS Fingerprint), OSF (passive OS fingerprinting for
                    iptables) and Ettercap. In this paper we discuss Nmap and p0f.</p>
