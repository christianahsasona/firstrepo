        <h1>Groupers</h1>
        <p><span class="first-sentence">Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes), typically having a stout body and a 
            large mouth.</span> They can  be quiet large, and lengths over a meter and weights upto 100 kg are not
            uncommon. though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than
            biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates
            inside the pharyx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crutaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest
            species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus Lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.
        </p>

        <p><span class="first-sentence">Their mouth and gills form a powrefull sucking system that sucks tjeir prey in from distance.</span> They also use their mouts to dig into sand to form their 
            shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are powerful, it is nearly impossibkle to pull them out of a cave if 
        they feel attacked and extend those muscles to look themselves in.</p>
